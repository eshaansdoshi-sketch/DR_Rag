🧠 Strategic Direction Options

You can position this as:

Agentic Research Infrastructure

AI Governance & Audit Tool

Enterprise Knowledge Engine

Deep Research Assistant

Policy Analysis Engine

🔥 Current Maturity Level

Today your system is:

Structured Reflective RAG Engine
With deterministic scoring
And limited adaptive iteration

Not yet:

Fully adaptive autonomous agent
Not yet persistent
Not yet production-scaled

But architecturally strong.
